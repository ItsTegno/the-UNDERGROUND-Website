This project is a simple web page that demonstrates the structure of a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application.

## Project Structure

```
basic-web-page
├── src
│   ├── index.html       # Main HTML document
│   ├── styles
│   │   └── style.css    # Styles for the web page

```

## Getting Started

To set up and run the web page, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```
   cd basic-web-page
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser:
   - You can simply double-click the `index.html` file in the `src` folder or open it using a web server for better results.

## Usage

- The `index.html` file serves as the entry point for the web page.
- The `style.css` file contains all the styles that define the look and feel of the web page.
- The `main.js` file includes JavaScript code that adds interactivity to the web page.
